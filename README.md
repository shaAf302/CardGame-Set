# CardGame-Set
The goal of the game is to find SETs of three cards from the twelve cards placed on the desk. All cards have four properties:

SHAPE: oval, squiggle, diamond
COLOR: red, green, purlple
NUMBER: 1,2, or 3 shapes
SHADING: solid, striped or outlined shapes (only used in the subtasks for bonus points)
Every SET consists of three cards, where all properties are:

the same on all of the cards
different on all of the cards.
The selected cards have to adhere to these rules for ALL properties. Worded differently: if the three cards have the same number of shapes, or 1 2 and 3; if the color is the same, or all three colors; if all shapes are solid, or one solid, striped and empty, etc...
